This project is a full-stack application that allows the user to create, read, update, and
delete brewery reviews. A request is sent to an external API upon 500ms elapsing when the user
has typed into the input bar on the homepage, and another is sent to gather additional data
when the review is submitted. This application utilizes a SQL-based database solution.

I made this app in order to demonstrate the skills I've learned in CSS/SCSS, Tailwind,
HTML, EJS, jQuery, axios, Node, Express, postgreSQL, JavaScript, Webpack, Webpack Dev Server,
and various other smaller NPM packages.

Run npm install, followed by NPM run start to use this application.
